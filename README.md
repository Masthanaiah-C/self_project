## Running the CODE
Code is written on a Windows,windows users can run it on Windows Terminals and **other users** can run it on their own terminals using their own commands **link reference for commands:** [COMMANDS](https://www.lemoda.net/windows/windows2unix/windows2unix.html), **Hence code might not run on other platforms**   
Codes were further executed using **python version above 2.7** better use **python3.8.3** and you can also run it in **command prompt**   

Clone into repository
```batch
git clone https://github.com/Masthanaiah-C/self_project    
```
Navigate into repository
```batch
cd self_project
```

To run the code execute the below comment 
``` batch
python main.py
```
This will check all the requirements and tell you in case the requirements are not met. In case all the requirements are met it will start running your code.

However you can also follow the following instructions to install all the requirements.
**Step 1: Check if PIP is Already Installed**
Before you **install PIP on Windows**, check if PIP is already installed.
```batch
pip help
```
If PIP responds, then PIP is installed. Otherwise, there will be an error saying the program could not be found.

PIP is automatically installed with Python 2.7.9+ and Python 3.4+.

PIP also comes with the virtualenv and pyvenv virtual environments.
**Step 2: Verify Python Installation**
As a Python utility, PIP requires an active Python installation. In newer versions of Python and Python-enabled virtual environments, PIP is already installed, and you do not need to reinstall it.

To determine whether you have Python installed:

* Open the Command Prompt window
* When the console window opens, type in:
```batch
python
```
If this command is not unrecognized, you need to install Python before you can install PIP.

If the command is recognized, Python responds with its version and a list of commands.

When Python is installed correctly, you should see:
```batch
Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jan 25 2019, 07:44:31) [MSC v.1914 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
